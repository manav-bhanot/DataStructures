 *         A disjoint-set data structure is a structure that maintains a
 *         collection S1, S2, S3, …, Sn of dynamic disjoint sets. Two sets are
 *         disjoint if their intersection is null. For example set {1, 2, 3} and
 *         set {1, 5, 6} aren’t disjoint because they have in common {1}, but
 *         the sets {1, 2, 3} and {5, 6} are disjoint because their intersection
 *         is null. In a data structure of disjoint sets every set contains a
 *         representative, which is one member of the set.
